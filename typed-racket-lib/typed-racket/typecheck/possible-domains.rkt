;; to avoid long and confusing error messages, in the case of functions with
;; multiple similar domains (<, >, +, -, etc.), we show only the domains that
;; are relevant to this specific error
;; this is done in several ways:
;; - if a case-lambda case is subsumed by another, we don't need to show it
;;   (subsumed cases may be useful for their prop information, but this is
;;   unrelated to error reporting)
;; - if we have an expected type, we don't need to show the domains for which
;;   the result type is not a subtype of the expected type
;; - we can disregard domains that are more restricted than required to get
;;   the expected type (or all but the most liberal domain when no type is
;;   expected)
;;   ex: if we have the 2 following possible domains for an operator:
;;       Fixnum -> Fixnum
;;       Integer -> Integer
;;     and an expected type of Integer for the result of the application,
;;     we can disregard the Fixnum domain since it imposes a restriction that
;;     is not necessary to get the expected type
;; This function can be used in permissive or restrictive mode.
;; in permissive mode, domains that are not consistent with the expected type
;; may still be considered possible. This is useful for error messages, where
;; we want to collapse domains always, regardless of expected type. In
;; restrictive mode, only domains that are consistent with the expected type can
;; be considered possible. This is useful when computing the possibly empty set
;; of domains that would *satisfy* the expected type, e.g. for the :query-type
;; forms.
;; TODO separating pruning and collapsing into separate functions may be nicer
