name: Resyntax Analysis

# The Resyntax integration is split into two phases: a workflow that analyzes the code and uploads
# the analysis as an artifact, and a workflow that downloads the analysis artifact and creates a
# review of the pull request. This split is for permissions reasons; the analysis workflow checks out
# the pull request branch and compiles it, executing arbitrary code as it does so. For that reason,
# the first workflow has read-only permissions in the github repository. The second workflow only
# downloads the pull request review artifact and submits it, and it executes with read-write permissions
# without executing any code in the repository. This division of responsibilities allows Resyntax to
# safely analyze pull requests from forks. This strategy is outlined in the following article:
# https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
