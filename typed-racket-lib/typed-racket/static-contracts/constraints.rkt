;; Manages the restrictions on what kind of contract is viable.
;; Some combinators cannot support arbitrary contracts. Ex: hash/c needs a flat contract on the key.
;; This module provides the functions for manipulating a set of such constraints.
;;
;; Constructors:
;;   simple-contract-restrict: kind? -> contract-restrict?
;;     This means that the generated contract will be contract of the supplied kind.
;;
;;   variable-contract-restrict: identifier? -> contract-restrict?
;;     This means that the generated contract will be of the same kind as the recursive contract
;;     referenced by the variable.
;;
;;   merge-restricts: kind? contract-restrict? ... -> contract-restrict?
;;   merge-restricts*: kind? (listof contracct-restrict?) -> contract-restrict?
;;     This means that the generated contract will be the max of kind and all of the other contract
;;     restricts.
;;
;;   add-constraint: contract-restrict? kind? -> contract-restrict
;;     This means the kind of the generated contract can not be greater than the supplied kind.
;;
;;   close-loop: (lisotf identifier?) (listof contract-restrict?) contract-restrict? -> contract-restrict?
;;     This takes a bunch of recursive contract identifiers, their corresponding contract-restricts,
;;     the contract restrict for a body and constructs the appropriate constract restrict.
;;
;; Other:
;;   validate-constraints: contract-restrict? -> void?
;;     This takes a contract-restrict and raises an exception if it has any violated constraints.
;;
;;   contract-restrict-recursive-values: contract-restrict? -> (dict/c identifier? kind?)
;;     Provides the kinds of all of the internal recursive contracts that are a part of the
;;     contract-restrict.
