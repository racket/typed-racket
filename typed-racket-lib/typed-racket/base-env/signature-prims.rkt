;; The `define-signature-internal` form specifies
;; - the `name` of the signature being defined
;; - it's parent-signature, or #f if this signature does not extend another signature
;; - the list of member variables contained in this signature along with their types
;; - and a boolean flag indicating whether the signature came from an instance of
;;   require/typed in which case additional checking must occur when the internal
;;   form is parsed
