# Summary

Brief (e.g. one paragraph) explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were
teaching it to another Typed Racket programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Typed Racket programmers should *think* about the feature.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for type checker internals), focus on how
type system contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its
concrete impact.

# Reference-level explanation

Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

Return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how
the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks and Alternatives
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Could we do something else instead?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- Papers: Are there published papers, books, great blog posts, etc that discuss this? Be _specific_!


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
