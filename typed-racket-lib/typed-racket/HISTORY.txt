  See https://pnwamk.github.io/blog/2017/01/08/some-changes-in-typed-racket-v6-8/
  for more details.
- Add `typed/setup/getinfo`, `typed/images/compile-time`, `typed/file/glob`,
  `typed/racket/gui/no-check`
- Add `(Intersection ...)` syntax.
- Fix type checking of optional & keyword arguments to be sound.
6.7

- Support polymorphic structs in `unsafe-require/typed`
- Add `typed/racket/os` and `typed/racket/db{/sqlite3}`.
6.6
- Warn on opaque values passed to `any-wrap/c`. This will become an
  error in the future.
- Added intersection types.
- Add typed/syntax/{modread,srcloc,readerr}
- Improve type & contract serialization and avoid pconvert.
- Check source type in `cast` (potential incompatibility)
- Internal: rename "filter" to "prop"
6.5
- Added `simple-result->` to improve generated contract performance.
- Improve error message printing.
- Add `typed/racket/random`.
- Internal: populate type table unconditionally, for use in tooltips.
6.4
- Contract performance improvements, including generating code that
  the contract system can optimize
- Make `any-wrap/c` more permissive on opaque structs.
- Soundly check opaque predicates.
- Add `#:type-name` option to `struct`.
6.3
- Startup time reduction
- Tightening and cleanup of numeric types
- Sealing contracts for row polymorphic types
- `define-new-subtype`
- More robust compound pair operations optimizations
- Redesign of top-level support, using trampolining macros
- Static contract caching more conservative, causes contract generation slowdowns
- Experimental unit support
- `typed/racket/unsafe`, with `unsafe-require/typed` and `unsafe-provide`
6.2
- Use submodules to avoid allocating contract wrappers when not needed.
- Class types and contract generation are significantly improved, but still experimental.
- Many types for GUI classes added.
- Tests on let-bound variables now refine the type of what was bound to them.
- DrRacket tooltips for types and type errors.
- Support for prefab structs.
- Types for a variety of libraries, including `rackunit` and `json`.
6.1.1
- Exception handling is now sound. Broke existing programs (e.g. marketplace).
- More types for GUI and framework.
- Support for casts and predicates in typed regions.
6.1
- Inference speedups.
- Support for contracted functions in the base environment.
- Better keyword support.
6.0.1
- Types for classes (including row types, sealing contracts, etc).
  Still experimental.  
- Contracts are now optimized; in particular, redundant contracts are omitted
- Filters work with conditions that raise errors, as in the pattern
  (begin (unless (number? x) (error 'fail))
         (add1 x))
- Types are now pretty-printed
- Add prefix-style function types and `->*` function type constructor
- Support syntactic forms without : (such as let, lambda, for, etc)
- Type aliases support arbitrary mutual recursion
- Inform check-syntax about expansion results
- Add `typed/untyped-utils` library
- Add `typed/syntax/stx`, `typed/pict`, 
- Significant test suite improvments
- Improved support for `Struct-Type` values
- Support keyword function definitions without annotation.
- Handle forward references in un-annotated definitions
- Improve type inference for `letrec`-bound variables
6.0
- Support for `define-type', `struct:', `make-predicate', etc. at the REPL
- Performance work: optimized subtyping
- Make `struct:' have the correct bindings in struct info
- Use pairs for objects on arrow types
- Split off `recover-source-syntax' into a separate package and generalized it
- Lots of doc improvements
- Lots of error message improvements
- Split into multiple packages
