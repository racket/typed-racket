@title{Typed Classes}

@bold{Warning}: the features described in this section are experimental
and may not work correctly. Some of the features will change by
the next release. In particular, typed-untyped interaction for classes
will not be backwards compatible so do not rely on the current semantics.

Typed Racket provides support for object-oriented programming with
the classes and objects provided by the @racketmodname[racket/class]
library.

@section{Special forms}

@defmodule[typed/racket/class]

The special forms below are provided by the @racketmodname[typed/racket/class]
and @racketmodname[typed/racket] modules but not by
@racketmodname[typed/racket/base]. The @racketmodname[typed/racket/class] module
additional provides all other bindings from @racketmodname[racket/class].

  Produces a class with type annotations that allows Typed Racket to type-check
  the methods, fields, and other clauses in the class.

  The meaning of the class clauses are the same as in the @class-element
  form from the @racketmodname[racket/class] library with the exception of
  the additional optional type annotations. Additional class clause
  forms from @class-element that are not listed in the grammar above are
  not currently supported in Typed Racket.

  @ex[
    (define fish%
      (class object%
        (init [size : Real])

        (: current-size Real)
        (define current-size size)

        (super-new)

        (: get-size (-> Real))
        (define/public (get-size)
          current-size)

        (: grow (Real -> Void))
        (define/public (grow amt)
          (set! current-size (+ amt current-size)))

        (: eat ((Object [get-size (-> Real)]) -> Void))
        (define/public (eat other-fish)
          (grow (send other-fish get-size)))))

    (define dory (new fish% [size 5.5]))
  ]

  Within a typed class form, one of the class clauses must be a call
  to @racket[super-new]. Failure to call @racket[super-new] will result in
  a type error. In addition, dynamic uses of @racket[super-new] (e.g.,
  calling it in a separate function within the dynamic extent of the
  class form's clauses) are restricted.

  @ex[
    (eval:error
     (class object%
       (code:comment "Note the missing `super-new`")
       (init-field [x : Real 0] [y : Real 0])))
  ]

  If any identifier with an optional type annotation is left without an
  annotation, the type-checker will assume the type @racket[Any]
  (or @racket[Procedure] for methods) for that identifier.

  @ex[
    (define point%
      (class object%
        (super-new)
        (init-field x y)))
    point%
  ]

  When @racket[type-variable] is provided, the class is parameterized
  over the given type variables. These type variables are in scope inside
  the body of the class. The resulting class can be instantiated at
  particular types using @racket[inst].

  @ex[
    (define cons%
      (class object%
        #:forall (X Y)
        (super-new)
        (init-field [car : X] [cdr : Y])))
    cons%
    (new (inst cons% Integer String) [car 5] [cdr "foo"])
  ]

  Initialization arguments may be provided by-name using the @racket[new]
  form, by-position using the @racket[make-object] form, or both using
  the @racket[instantiate] form.

  As in ordinary Racket classes, the order in which initialization arguments
  are declared determines the order of initialization types in the class type.

  Furthermore, a class may also have a typed @racket[init-rest] clause, in
  which case the class constructor takes an unbounded number of arguments
  by-position. The type of the @racket[init-rest] clause must be either a
  @racket[List] type, @racket[Listof] type, or any other list type.

  @ex[
    (define point-copy%
      (code:comment "a point% with a copy constructor")
      (class object%
        (super-new)
        (init-rest [rst : (U (List Integer Integer)
                             (List (Object (field [x Integer]
                                                  [y Integer]))))])
        (field [x : Integer 0] [y : Integer 0])
        (match rst
          [(list (? integer? *x) *y)
           (set! x *x) (set! y *y)]
          [(list (? (negate integer?) obj))
           (set! x (get-field x obj))
           (set! y (get-field y obj))])))

  These forms are mostly equivalent to the forms of the same names from
  the @racketmodname[racket/class] library and will expand to them. However,

                    [name+type [id type]])]{
  The type of a class with the given initialization argument, method, and
  field types.

  @ex[
    (: food% (Class (init [liquid? Boolean])
                    (field [nutrition Integer])
                    [get-nutrition (-> Integer)]))
  ]

  The types of methods are provided either without a keyword, in which case
  they correspond to public methods, or with the @racketidfont{augment}
  keyword, in which case they correspond to a method that can be augmented.

  An initialization argument type specifies a name and type and optionally
  a @racket[#:optional] keyword. An initialization argument type with
  @racket[#:optional] corresponds to an argument that does not need to
  be provided at object instantiation.

  @ex[
    (: drink% (Class (init [color String]
                           [carbonated? Boolean]
                           [viscosity Positive-Real #:optional])))
  ]

  The order of initialization arguments in the type is significant, because
  it determines the types of by-position arguments for use with
  @racket[make-object] and @racket[instantiate]. A given @racket[Class] type
  may also only contain a single @racket[init-rest] clause.

  @ex[
    (define drink%
      (class object%
        (super-new)
        (code:comment "The order of `color' and `carbonated?' cannot be swapped")
        (init color carbonated? [viscosity 1.002])))
    (code:comment "The order of initialization matches the order in the type")
    (make-object drink% "purple" #t)
  ]

  When @racket[type-alias-id] is provided, the resulting class type
  includes all of the method and field types from the specified type alias
  (which must be an alias for a class type). This is intended to allow a type
  for a subclass to include parts of its parent class type. The initialization argument
  types of the parent, however, are @emph{not} included because a subclass does not necessarily
  share the same initialization arguments as its parent class.

  Initialization argument types can be included from the parent by providing
  @racket[inits-id] with the @racket[#:implements/inits] keyword. This is identical
  to the @racket[#:implements] clause except for the initialization argument
  behavior. Only a single @racket[#:implements/inits] clause may be provided for
  a single @racket[Class] type. The initialization arguments copied from the parent
  type are appended to the initialization arguments specified via the @racket[init]
  and @racket[init-field] clauses.

  Multiple @racket[#:implements] clauses may be provided for a single class
  type. The types for the @racket[#:implements] clauses are merged in order and the
  last type for a given method name or field is used (the types in the @racket[Class]
  type itself takes precedence).

  @ex[
    (define-type Point<%> (Class (field [x Real] [y Real])))
    (: colored-point% (Class #:implements Point<%>
                             (field [color String])))
  ]

  When @racket[row-var-id] is provided, the class type is an abstract type
  that is row polymorphic. A row polymorphic class type can be instantiated
  at a specific row using @racket[inst]. Only a single @racket[#:row-var]
  clause may appear in a class type.
}

@defidform[ClassTop]{
  The supertype of all class types. A value of this type
  cannot be used for subclassing, object creation, or most
  other class functions. Its primary use is for reflective
  operations such as @racket[is-a?].
}

@defform[#:literals (field)
         (Object object-type-clause ...)
         #:grammar ([object-type-clause name+type
                                        (field name+type ...)])]{
  The type of an object with the given field and method types.

  @ex[
    (new object%)
    (new (class object% (super-new) (field [x : Real 0])))
  ]
}

@defform[(Instance class-type-expr)]{
  The type of an object that corresponds to @racket[class-type-expr].

  This is the same as an @racket[Object] type that has all of the
  method and field types from @racket[class-type-expr]. The types for
  the @racketidfont{augment} and @racketidfont{init} clauses in the
  class type are ignored.
